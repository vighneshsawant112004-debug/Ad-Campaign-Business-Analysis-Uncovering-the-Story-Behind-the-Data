# 🎯 Ad Campaign Business Analysis — Uncovering the Story Behind the Data

## 📘 Overview

* **This project dives deep into advertising campaign data to uncover what truly drives engagement, clicks, and conversions.
By analyzing multiple datasets and combining them into one unified view, we reveal how campaign duration, platforms, and audience behavior impact performance.**


## Project Highlights

🔹 4 datasets merged to build a complete picture of campaign performance.**

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly).

🔹 Interactive charts that show engagement trends, funnel drop-offs, and performance by platform and gender.

🔹 Campaign insights on duration effectiveness, weekend conversions, and audience targeting.

🔹 Actionable recommendations to improve ad strategies and conversion rates.
